<h1>
    About the Delta Chapter
</h1>
<p>In

  the Spring of 1996, the

  chapter decided that we need our own flag to represent us at various

  meetings, workshops, and conventions. Through many debates and

  the looking over of several designs, the Brotherhood finally decided

  on a symbol of representation.</p>

<p>The

  center of the flag is similar to the National Flag of the Fraternity:

  a blue banner over a white bottom. The white letters of KKY&nbsp

  are on the blue field while the blue numbers 1919 are on the white

  field, representing the founding year of the Fraternity. In the

  center of these is a five-pointed gold star. From the sides of

  the flag are triangular red fields with white lettering which

  represent the school colors of the University of Oklahoma. On

  the left red field are the interlocking OU and the numbers 1890,

  which are the symbol and founding date of the University. On the

  right red field are the Greek symbol Delta and the numbers 1921,

  which represent the Delta Chapter of the Fraternity and its founding

  date.</p>
